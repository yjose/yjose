👋 Hello

 I'm Youssouf, a human first 🙌, from Morocco 🇲🇦. I'm a mobile tribe leader at Obytes and a core team member of the Geekblabla community. 
 
 I'm a believer in open-source and a part-time blogger. I mainly enjoy working with React and React Native. I like reading and listening to anything related to Software Development, Psychology and Human Behavior. I also enjoy playing soccer as well as walking and running.
